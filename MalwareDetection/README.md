# Malware Detection using Bayesian Network

This Python program uses a Bayesian Network to model and predict the likelihood of a piece of code being malware or legitimate software.

## How it works

The Bayesian Network is built using the `pomegranate` library. It consists of four nodes:

- `code`: Represents the type of code (plain-text, binary, or obfuscated).
- `resize`: Represents whether the code resizes itself.
- `signature`: Represents whether a known malware signature is present.
- `outcome`: Represents the final classification (malware or software).

Each node is connected to form the Bayesian Network, and the network is then "baked" to finalize its structure.

The program then calculates the probability of certain combinations of node states being malware, and makes predictions based on given node states.

## How to run the program

1. Ensure you have Python and the `pomegranate` library installed on your machine.
2. Clone this repository or download the `malwareDetection.py` file.
3. Open a terminal/command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the `malwareDetection.py` file.
4. Run the command `python malwareDetection.py`.
5. The program will calculate probabilities and make predictions based on the Bayesian Network.

## Example

```python
low_probability = model.probability(
    [["plain-text", "yes", "absent", "malware"]])

predictions = model.predict_proba({
    "code": "plain-text",
    "resize": "yes",
    "signature": "present"
})

low_probability_prediction = predictions[3].parameters[0]['software']
```

In this example, the program calculates the probability of plain-text code that resizes itself and does not have a known malware signature being malware. It then predicts the likelihood of such code being legitimate software.

## Note
This is a simple program and does not use real-world data. The probabilities used in the Bayesian Network are hypothetical and for demonstration purposes only.
